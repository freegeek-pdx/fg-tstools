Usage: ts_network_backup  [OPTION(S)]
Create or restore network backup. 

By default it backs up the contents of /home, the users on the system and the 
packages that have been installed (via apt-get, Ubuntu Software Center etc). 

        -h              	Prints this message
        -c [ticket number] 	Create network backup
	-r [backup directory] 	Restore network backup. The backup directory 
				should be in the format date-ticket_number.
	-d 			Data only. Does not backup/restore users or 
				packages.
				Use of this option is strongly discouraged.
	-u 			Users and data only. Does not backup/restore 
				packages. 
				Use of this option is discouraged.
	-l [log file]		Log messages to file rather than stdout.
				Be careful not to use the same path for backing
				up and restoring, or the  log file may get 
				overwritten.
	-t [addendum]		Normally this script checks to see if a ticket
				number looks like a "real" ticket number. 
				(i.e. it has the correct number of numbers). 
				This option lets you add things to this number. 
				It's useful if you are backing up more than one
				computer and want to store them in different 
				folders referring to the same ticket.
				e.g. 00001-A and 00001-B
				Takes letters, numbers and _only. - is added automatically.  
	-a /path/to/directory   Alternative directory to backup. Implies  -d 
				i.e. does not backup users or packages.
				Use this if you want to backup something
			        other than the home directory.
                                e.g. an external windows drive.
				Suggests the use of -A for restoring backups.
	-f 			force the backup of a single file rather than a directory 
	-F			Force the overwriting an existing backup 
				or restoring with -A and not -d 
	-A /path/to/directory	Use this to restore the backup to somewhere
                                other than /home
                                Can be used with or without -u or -d,
                                suggests the later 
				(required if needed) -F must be used if -d isn't. 
	-p /path/to/home	Use this if the home folder you want to
				backup is not in its usual place i.e. if you
				to backup an external/mounted drive 
				rather than /home.
				You do not need to add home on the end but the
				script does not mind either way. 
				Can be used with or without -u or -d. 	
	
Use this to create or restore network backups. By default it will attempt to restore users, their data and settings, and the progams installed on the machine.
