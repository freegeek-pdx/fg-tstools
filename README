This is a set of command line tools that automate common tasks in Tech Support.
They can be run by using e.g.
    /path/to/command
or by cd-ing into this directory and running ./command

You should note that they are already installed on tsdata in /usr/local/bin so you should not use a local copy but just run the name of the command.

The main tools of interest are ts_network_backup which automates the backup process, and ts_identify_backup which identifies a backup directory given a ticket number.

Anything that ends in .sh or .cfg is not a command and should be ignored (do not delete these as they are used by other files).

All commands come with a built in help system that can be accessed with the -h option.

(As it is rather long the help section for ts_network_backup is included below).

The following tools work only with Ubuntu 10.04 at present:
ts_reset_gnome, ts_reset_panel, ts_reset_windowmanager

The following have been obsoleted by changed procedures, to some extent, but may be useful on odd occasions:
ts_login_as_user, ts_make_tsuser, ts_revert_passwords

================================================================================

For a standard backup ts_network_backup -c [TICKET NO] to backup is sufficient.
To restore first identify the backup folder 
ts_identify [TICKET NO] 
this will reurn the backup folderm, then
ts_network_backup -r [BACKUP_FOLDER].

N.B. on tsdata you MUST use the -p option to specify the path to the mounted disc.


Help for ts_network_backup
===========================
Usage: ts_network_backup  [OPTION(S)]
Create or restore network backup. 

By default it backs up the contents of /home, the users on the system and the 
packages that have been installed (via apt-get, Ubuntu Software Center etc). 

        -h              	Prints this message
        -c [ticket number] 	Create network backup
	-r [backup directory] 	Restore network backup. The backup directory 
				should be in the format date-ticket_number.
	-d 			Data only. Does not backup/restore users or 
				packages.
				Use of this option is strongly discouraged.
	-u 			Users and data only. Does not backup/restore 
				packages. 
				Use of this option is discouraged.
	-l [log file]		Log messages to file rather than stdout.
				Be careful not to use the same path for backing
				up and restoring, or the  log file may get 
				overwritten.
	-t [addendum]		Normally this script checks to see if a ticket
				number looks like a "real" ticket number. 
				(i.e. it has the correct number of numbers). 
				This option lets you add things to this number. 
				It's useful if you are backing up more than one
				computer and want to store them in different 
				folders referring to the same ticket.
				e.g. 00001-A and 00001-B
				Takes letters, numbers and _only. - is added automatically.  
	-a /path/to/directory   Alternative directory to backup. Implies  -d 
				i.e. does not backup users or packages.
				Use this if you want to backup something
			        other than the home directory.
                                e.g. an external windows drive.
				Suggests the use of -A for restoring backups.
	-f 			force the backup of a single file rather than a directory 
	-F			Force the overwriting an existing backup 
				or restoring with -A and not -d 
	-A /path/to/directory	Use this to restore the backup to somewhere
                                other than /home
                                Can be used with or without -u or -d,
                                suggests the later 
				(required if needed) -F must be used if -d isn't. 
	-p /path/to/home	Use this if the home folder you want to
				backup is not in its usual place i.e. if you
				to backup an external/mounted drive 
				rather than /home.
				You do not need to add home on the end but the
				script does not mind either way. 
				Can be used with or without -u or -d. 	
	
Use this to create or restore network backups. By default it will attempt to restore users, their data and settings, and the progams installed on the machine.
